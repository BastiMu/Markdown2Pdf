## Branching Strategy

Please make sure to fork the repo and then create your own branch based on the `develop` branch instead of `main`. This helps to ensure that `main` only contains stable and tested code.

## Pull Request

When you have changes ready to be merged, please open a pull request back to the `develop` branch.
